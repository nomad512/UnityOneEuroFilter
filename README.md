# OneEuroFilter Unity Package

*OneEuroFilter Unity Package* is a heavily modified version of [*One Euro Filter utility for Unity*](https://github.com/DarioMazzanti/OneEuroFilterUnity). It has been altered in the following ways:
1. Naming and style was updated to better follow .NET coding standards.
2. Asset files are packaged for Unity Package Manager.
3. Generic typing was removed to reduce performance overhead from boxing/unboxing.
4. Refactoring was done to reduce performance overhead from unnecessary data copying. 
5. Filter parameters have been refactored into a struct for improved readabilty. 

Both versions are based on the [OneEuroFilter](http://www.lifl.fr/~casiez/1euro/) by GÃ©ry Casiez, Nicolas Roussel, and Daniel Vogel.
